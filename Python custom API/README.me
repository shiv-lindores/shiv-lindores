This was python code created to extract the datasources used by all the reports in the company. 
At the time, you could only pass through one dataset_id (i.e. report) into the datasource API URL at a time. 
To do this in Power BI would be inefficient, so I had designed this code to extract an excel file containing a list of datasets (reports) in the company and an array of their associated datasources which they use for reporting.
